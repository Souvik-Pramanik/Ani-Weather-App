```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ani-weather-app.git
cd ani-weather-app
```

---

### **3. Configure the API Key**

1. Open `lib/services/weather_service.dart`.
2. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your OpenWeatherMap API key:
   ```dart
   const String apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY";
   ```

---

### **4. Install Dependencies**

Run the following command to fetch the required dependencies:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

---

### **5. Run the Application**

#### **On Android**:

1. Connect your Android device or open an emulator.
2. Run:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

#### **On iOS**:

## **How It Works**

1. **Weather Search**:

   - Enter a city name or use GPS to fetch weather details.

2. **Real-Time Updates**:

   - The app fetches live weather data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and condition descriptions.

3. **Dynamic Animations**:
   - Animations update in real-time to reflect current weather conditions (e.g., rain animation for rainy weather).
